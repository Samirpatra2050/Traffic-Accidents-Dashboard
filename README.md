# Traffic Accidents Dashboard
**Interactive Power BI traffic accidents dashboard — KPI summary, first & second pages for trends, types, and safety measures.**

## Description
This Power BI project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes global traffic accident data to help transport authorities, road-safety analysts, and policy makers monitor accidents, fatalities, injuries, and the effectiveness of safety measures. The dashboard contains two main pages (First page and Second page) with KPI cards, trend analysis, accident-type breakdowns, and a table of yearly aggregates.

## Business Problem
Transport departments and safety agencies often rely on fragmented reports and manual spreadsheets to understand accident trends. This slows response to emerging hotspots, makes it harder to evaluate the impact of road safety measures (like seatbelt enforcement and speed limits), and limits the ability to prioritize interventions across countries and years.

## Goal of the Dashboard
Provide a centralized interactive view of accident counts, fatalities, injuries, and rates across countries and years.
Enable policy teams to compare accident types, spot trends over time, and evaluate road safety measures.
Help prioritize regions and interventions with the highest potential to reduce fatalities and injuries.

## Key Visuals
KPI Cards: Total accidents, Total fatalities, Total injuries, Max accident count, Avg accidents per year, Injury rate, Fatality rate, Min/Max accident counts.
Line Chart: Total accidents by year (trend analysis).
Bar Charts: Total accidents by country; Total accidents by accident type (Vehicle-to-Vehicle, Pedestrian, Cyclist) and by road safety measure.
Pie/Donut Chart: Share of accidents by road safety measures (seatbelt enforcement, alcohol laws, speed limits).
Table: Yearly aggregates showing Total_accidents, Total_Fatalities, Total_injuries with totals and drill-down capability.
Slicers / Buttons: Country selector, Year filter, Page navigation buttons (First page / Second page).

## Business Impact & Insights
Prioritize Interventions: Identifies countries and years with spikes in accidents so agencies can target enforcement and infrastructure improvements.
Measure Effectiveness: Compares accident volumes across different safety measures to evaluate policy impact (e.g., countries with strict seatbelt laws vs. those without).
Resource Allocation: Helps policymakers allocate emergency response and prevention budgets to regions with the greatest need.
Public Awareness & Reporting: Visuals and KPIs provide a clear way to report to stakeholders and the public, improving transparency.
Trend Detection: Year-over-year trends and type breakdowns help detect rising risks (e.g., increases in cyclist accidents) and inform targeted campaigns.

## How to view
1. Open `Traffic_Accidents_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2. Use the left-side buttons to switch between First and Second pages.
3. Apply filters (Country, Year) to explore the data.
